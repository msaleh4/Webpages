  <p>Hello! My name is Mahmoud Saleh, and I'm a junior at NC State University majoring in Civil Engineering. I'm especially interested in transportation systems and how infrastructure impacts communities.</p>

  <p>This past summer, I interned with ECS (Engineering Consulting Services) doing construction material testing. I helped perform soil and concrete testing, both on-site and in the lab. I learned a lot about quality control, reporting, and real-world construction practices.</p>
